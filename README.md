# TenorPluginMaubot
[Maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) plugin that responds to a tenor link with the actual file itself

## Use case
When using a bridge (like a discord bridge), other services may send over the bridge a link to a tenor image. Matrix doesn't embed this, so users on the Matrix side will just see a link.

## Installation
- **Make sure bs4 is installed in your python environment.**
- Download the .mbp from Releases (or build yourself) and add it in the Maubot Manager.
